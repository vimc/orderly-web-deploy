vault:
  ## Address of the vault server.  This should be a string if it is
  ## present.
  addr: ~
  auth:
    ## Authentication type - must be either "token" or the name of a
    ## supported authentication method.  These seem to be poorly
    ## documented in the hvac, but include "github" for github
    ## authentication.
    ##
    ## On a vault client object, see auth.implemented_class_names for
    ## a list, which is currently
    ##
    ##     azure, github, gcp, kubernetes, ldap, mfa, okta
    method: github

## Prefix for container names; we'll use {container_prefix}_(orderly,web)
container_prefix: orderly_web

## The name of the docker network that containers will be attached to.
## If you want to proxy OrderlyWeb to the host, you will need to
## arrange a proxy on this network, or use dev_mode in the web section
## below.
network: orderly_web_network

## Names of the docker volumes to use:
##
## orderly: stores the orderly archive
## proxy_logs: stores logs from the reverse proxy (only used if proxy is given)
##
## (More volumes are anticipated as the tool develops)
volumes:
  orderly: orderly_web_volume
  proxy_logs: orderly_web_proxy_logs
  redis: orderly_web_redis_data

## Redis configuration
redis:
  image:
    name: redis
    tag: "5.0"
  volume: orderly_web_redis_data

## Orderly configuration
orderly:
  ## Image to use for orderly.  This should build off of
  ## vimc/orderly.server but can be extended to use whatever packages
  ## you need.  The components repo, image and tag will be assembled as
  ## <repo>/<name>:<tag> for the full docker image reference.
  image:
    repo: vimc
    name: orderly.server
    tag: master
  ## Environment variables that will be made available to orderly.
  ## Typically these will be in SHOUTY_SNAKE_CASE.  To pull values
  ## from the vault, use the format VAULT:<path>:<key>
  env:
    ORDERLY_DB_HOST: db_host
    ORDERLY_DB_USER: db_user
    ORDERLY_DB_PASS: VAULT:secret/db/password:value
  initial:
    source: demo

## Api and Website configuration
web:
  ## Image to use for the web components.  As for the orderly
  ## configuration these will be assembled as <repo>/<name>:<tag>.  In
  ## addition, a second image with the database migration support will
  ## be used as <repo>/<migrate>:<tag>.  It is not expected (unlike
  ## the orderly image) that the 'name' and 'migrate' will need to be
  ## changed often, and it is expected that a web image will go
  ## together with corresponding migration and admin images.
  image:
    repo: vimc
    name: orderly-web
    tag: master
    migrate: orderlyweb-migrate
    admin: orderly-web-user-cli
  ## Public-facing url for the whole web service, including protocol
  ## (ideally https://), hostname and port (if not using standard
  ## ports).  Here, we're going to use the same as for the proxy but
  ## if you are using an external proxy then you'd use its hostname
  ## and port.
  url: https://localhost
  ## If dev_mode is true then the port is exposed to the host (as
  ## plain http).  Do not use in production.  The port is attached
  ## only to the localhost and will not be available from other
  ## machines
  dev_mode: true
  ## Port to use for the web service
  port: 8888
  ## Name of the web service (affects the UI)
  name: OrderlyWeb
  ## Email address of the web service
  email: admin@example.com
  ## Authentication configuration
  auth:
    ## Name of the github organisation if using github auth
    github_org: vimc
    ## Name of the team within this github organisation if using
    ## github auth (cuurrently must be "" - VIMC
    github_team: ""
    ## Enable or disable fine grained permissions
    fine_grained: true
    ## Enable montagu authentication provider
    montagu: true
    montagu_url: http://montagu
    montagu_api_url: http://montagu/api

## If running a proxy directly, fill this section in.  Otherwise you
## are responsible for proxying the application out of the docker
## network
proxy:
  enabled: true
  hostname: localhost
  port_http: 80
  port_https: 443
  image:
    repo: vimc
    name: orderly-web-proxy
    tag: mrc-211
